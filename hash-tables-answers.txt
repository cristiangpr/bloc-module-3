3. How does a hash table store data?
A:  by converting the key into a hash code and storing it in an array index.

4. How are hash tables and objects different?
A: Objects are used to store a static number of distinct values of different types. Hash tables for a variable number of consistently formatted values, each with an identifier.

5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:

6. Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.
A:

var ht = new Map();
 ht.set('5302456787', {name:'Doug', address:' 356 Parsons St.'});
 ht.set('7072235400', {name:'Bart',address:'200 Evergreen Terrace.'});
 ht.set('4156783420', {name:'Mike',address:'354 Hunt St.'});

console.log(ht.get('7072235400'));

7. Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.

A:
var ht = new Map();
 ht.set('candy12', {item: 'gum', quantity: 26});
 ht.set('beverages55', {Item: 'beer', quantity: 51 });
 ht.set('bread12',{item: 'whole wheat', quantity: 15});
 ht.set('meat05',{item: 'NY steak', quantity: 10});

console.log(ht.get('candy12'));
console.log(ht.get('meat05'));



8. Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.

const news = new Map();

 news.set('NY Times 04-12-1999', {publisher: 'NY Times', date: '04-12-1999', headline: 'We Love Ny'});
 news.set('SF Chronicle 06-10-1985', {publisher: 'SF Cronicle', date: '06-10-1985', headline: 'Rice-A-Roni is our Treat!'});
console.log(news.get('NY Times 04-12-1999'));
console.log(news.get('SF Chronicle 06-10-1985'))
