1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: finding a needle in a haystack


2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: Looking someone up in a phonebook. 

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
A: 7

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
A: 3

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Linear search because binary search won't work on unsorted collections. You could also sort the collection and use binary search.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Binary search because it is much faster and efficient than linear search when the collection is sorted. 


Programming Assignment:

7. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

A:
function binarySearch(items, value){
    var startIndex  = 0,
        stopIndex   = items.length - 1,
        middle      = Math.floor((stopIndex + startIndex)/2);
 
    while(items[middle] != value && startIndex < stopIndex){
 
       
        if (value < items[middle]){
            stopIndex = middle - 1;
        } else if (value > items[middle]){
            startIndex = middle + 1;
        }
 
       
        middle = Math.floor((stopIndex + startIndex)/2);
    }
 
   
    return (items[middle] != value) ? -1 : middle;
}

var dictionary = ['albania', 'albany', 'albatross', 'albe'];
console.log(binarySearch(dictionary, 'albatross'));

8. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

A:
 var linearSearch = function(collection, target) {
   var result = null, value;
   for(var i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {
     value = collection[i];
     if(value === target){
       result = i;
       break;
     }
   }
   return result;
   
 };
let tank = ['gf', 'gf', 'wsgf', 'gf'];

console.log(linearSearch(tank, 'wsgf'));
