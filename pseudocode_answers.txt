Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1.Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
a: IF number a > number b THEN
      PRINT number a
   ELSE
      PRINT number b
   END IF

2:Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
a: SET count to 1
   WHILE count =< 100
     PRINT count
     INCREMENT count
   END WHILE



3:Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

a: FIND entry in phonebook



4:Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

a: function findEntry(query){
     return phonebook.indexOf(query);}
